# sql-window-uber
Hi there. 

If you're viewing this, you're probably shopping around my portfolio. Maybe you're my future boss. Maybe you're a recruiter. Maybe you're a future client. Or maybe you're just a curious person. 

Whatever the case, it's lovely to meet you. 

## What is this?

Being a Data Journalist is part writer, part data visualiser, and part data-jack-of-all-trades. As part of my eagerness to tell better stories, and to carry out better data analysis (and keep my career options open), I've been practising and learning new SQL skills.

This problem was an SQL Interview problem on [datalemur.com](https://datalemur.com/questions/sql-third-transaction). It was the first medium difficulty problem I tackled on the website, and required the use of window functions to tackle it â€“ something I hadn't used before. 

## What did you learn?

* How to use window functions
* How to use rank() functions
* How to quickly learn new SQL techniques (I went through a tutorial on [mode.com](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions), and learned how to carry out the problem in less than 2 hours.)

## Where can I view the code?

**[You can see my jupyter notebook solution here.](https://nbviewer.org/github/david-heasman00/sql-window-uber/blob/main/Uber%20SQL%20Interview%20Question.ipynb)**

## How can I speak to you?

Want to chat about a project, or a potential opportunity? I'm happy to connect [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidheasman/). Include a brief note in your connection request about why you're reaching out. 

Till later.
